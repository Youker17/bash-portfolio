    Hey there, I'm Youssef, a Full Stack Developer with 2 years of experience building web applications and software systems. 
    I have a passion for creating intuitive and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.
    Throughout my career, I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from e-commerce platforms to social networking applications.
    My technical skills include proficiency in JavaScript, React, SQL, Python and Django (DRF).
    In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong communicator and a great team player.
    I enjoy collaborating with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to deliver high-quality projects that meet the needs of our clients.
    When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking in the mountains or reading a good book. 
    I believe that a healthy work-life balance is essential for maintaining creativity and productivity in the workplace.
    Thanks for stopping by my portfolio, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project!`,
